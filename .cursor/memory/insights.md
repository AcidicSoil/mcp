# Project Insights and Key Decisions

## `2025-01-27T23:30:00Z` LM Studio Integration Architecture Discovery

**Decision**: Implement three-tier architecture: Terminal Agent → Middleware → LM Studio
**Alternatives Considered**: Direct LM Studio integration, Complex multi-service architecture
**Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns, reusable middleware, modular components that can be independently tested and upgraded. The middleware acts as a translation layer between OpenAI API format and MCP protocol.

## `2025-01-27T23:30:00Z` Codex CLI Customization Strategy

**Decision**: Customize existing Codex CLI fork rather than build terminal agent from scratch
**Alternatives Considered**: Python-based custom CLI, Node.js lightweight implementation, Rust-based agent
**Rationale**: Existing Codex CLI provides proven terminal agent architecture, file system integration, and project context collection. Customization leverages mature codebase while integrating with our specific middleware.
**Category**: Implementation

## `2025-01-27T23:30:00Z` Local-First AI Architecture Benefits

**Decision**: Prioritize completely local AI stack (LM Studio + local middleware + local tools)
**Alternatives Considered**: Cloud API integration, Hybrid local/cloud approach
**Rationale**: Privacy preservation, no external API dependencies, faster response times, cost elimination, and complete control over the AI pipeline. Enables code-aware AI without sending proprietary code to external services.

## `2025-01-27T23:30:00Z` OpenAI Middleware Success Pattern

**Decision**: Use FastAPI-based middleware to translate OpenAI API calls to MCP protocol
**Alternatives Considered**: Direct MCP integration, Custom protocol development
**Rationale**: OpenAI API format is widely supported by AI tools and LM Studio. Middleware approach provides compatibility layer while maintaining MCP protocol benefits. Successfully tested and working.

## `2025-01-27T23:30:00Z` Task Management Context Integration

**Decision**: Embed task management capabilities directly into the terminal coding agent
**Alternatives Considered**: Separate task management interface, Web-based task dashboard
**Rationale**: Seamless developer workflow - tasks, code, and AI interaction all within the terminal environment. Reduces context switching and maintains focus on development work.
